# Zia (/seeya:/)

Zia is a minimal command line tool which makes you learn Zig 10% faster.

That is, if you add it to your Shell at startup. If you do that, every time your shell starts you will get a new random buildin function from Zig and its documentation.

Since we have all the functions and documentation built into the binary, it's _blazingly_ fast.

This is all you get:
